Offline Jarvis-Style AI Assistant
An offline, privacy-focused AI assistant modeled after Jarvis, built in Python. This assistant performs daily tasks, manages reminders, controls media playback, searches local files, and integrates with smart devices — all without relying on an internet connection.

Features
Offline operation: No internet required; all data remains local.

Voice interaction: Uses speech recognition and text-to-speech for natural communication.

Reminders: Set time-based reminders stored locally and notified via voice.

Media control: Play local music files with voice commands.

File search: Find files on your local machine by name.

Extensible architecture: Modular design allows easy addition of features.

Privacy-first: No external data transmission, keeping your information secure.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/offline-jarvis-ai.git
cd offline-jarvis-ai
Create required folders and files:

bash
mkdir -p data resources
echo "[]" > data/reminders.json
Add media files:

Place your .mp3 files inside the resources folder.

Ensure a file named sample_music.mp3 is present for the default music command.

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install pyttsx3 pygame SpeechRecognition schedule pyaudio
Note:

If pyaudio installation fails on Windows, try:

bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
On Linux/macOS, you might need system packages for portaudio before installing pyaudio.

Usage
Run the assistant with:

bash
python assistant.py
Example voice commands:
Set a reminder:
"Set reminder to take medicine in 10 minutes"

Play music:
"Play music"

Search for a file:
"Search file example.txt"

Exit assistant:
Say "stop", "quit", or "exit"

The assistant will reply via voice and text feedback.

Technical Details
Voice Recognition: Uses Google Speech Recognition API (online) by default.
(For fully offline voice recognition, integrate offline engines like Vosk separately.)

Text-to-Speech: Utilizes pyttsx3 for TTS, works offline.

Scheduling: The schedule library manages time-based reminders locally.

Media Playback: Uses pygame to play local audio files.

File Search: Recursively searches the current directory for files by name.

No external API dependencies: Ensures complete offline functionality except for speech recognition (which can be replaced for offline use).

Extending the Assistant
Integrate an offline speech recognition engine (e.g., Vosk) to achieve full offline voice input.

Add smart home device integration via local APIs or MQTT.

Implement natural language understanding with local language models.

Add a GUI or web interface for easier interaction.

Support additional commands like weather forecasts (using cached/local data).
